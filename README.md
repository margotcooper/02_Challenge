# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

For this assignment I created a portfolio page about myself. I used placeholder images and no links, except for the first placeholder, which I changed to link to Challenge 1 for this course. I also put a header that is fixed in the window, and all the internal links correctly go to each respective location on site.

Screenshots of deployed Challenge 2 application:
